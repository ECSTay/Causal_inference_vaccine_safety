R and Stancode used in the generating the descriptive statistics and analysis of the data for this paper.

Factors influencing signal detection were investigated upon data generated under 12 scenarios differing in prevalence of a moderate to SR and SP. The simulation code Data_generation_and_PPA_analysis.R includes the simulation function for different scenarios and also Bayesian analysis code applying the simplified PPA method. The LLLL scenario with N = 50,0000 was used as the reference data for the PPA anaylsis of each scenario with N = 4000. The same LLLL scenario was used as the reference data for the PPA analysis of each scenario. The scenarios each differ in the event probabilities incorporated in the data simulations. Please refer to the main text and supplementary materials for the details of the deisgn of the scenarios.
